    "In contrast to the User Mean Rating, this model focuses on the mean rating of each item and uses it to predict ratings for all users.\n",

    "4. **User-Item Mean Rating**:\n",
    "This model takes a more nuanced approach by predicting a rating for a user-item pair as the average of the user's mean rating and the item's mean rating. The formula is:\n",
    "$$prediction = \\frac{User Mean Rating + Item Mean Rating}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Weighted Mean Ratings**:\n",
    "This model employs a weighted average of the user mean and item mean ratings. The weight ( w ) can be adjusted based on domain understanding. The formula is :\n",
    "$$prediction = w \\times User Mean Rating + (1 - w) \\times Item Mean Rating, \\space where \\space 0 \\leq w \\leq 1$$"
