    "        1. Predictive Modeling: Building a model to predict budget or revenue based on other features (e.g., genre, popularity, runtime) could provide more accurate results\n",
    "        2. Binning: Instead of treating budget and revenue as continuous variables, you can categorize them into bins (e.g., low, medium, high).\n",
    "        3. Data Augmentation: Seek out additional data sources to fill in the missing budget and revenue information. \n",

    "- Now for the high-value outliers in [budget, populairty, revenue, vote_count]:\n",
    "    - It could be one of these ways:\n",
    "        1. Winsorization: capping the extreme values at a certain percentile. points above the 95th percentile are set to the value of the 95th percentile.\n",
    "        2. Binning: as explained before...\n",
    "        3. Transformation: Applying transformations to the data can reduce the impact of outliers. Log transformations, square root transformations, or Box-Cox transformations\n",
    "        4. Model-choice: we can use models that are less sensetive to outliers e.g. Tree-based models\n"
